This plugin can build a maze or a RPG-style "dungeon" easily.

The normal workflow is as follows:
- Set object mapping
- Set parameters
- Generate
- Build to layer

If you want more control over the process, you need to build to layer yourself using events or Python.

Parameters--
Size: dungeon width/height in tiles. Actual size can be +-1 tile to accommodate walls.
Tile size: Width/height of one tile in pixels
Seed: Number to base the randomization on. Same number = always same result.
Randomness: 0 - very straight corridors, 100 - lots of twists
Sparseness: 0 - very tight density, 100 - very sparse density
Dead end removal: percentage of dead ends the generator does its best to remove.
Room count: max/min.
Room dimensions: max/min height/width in tiles.

Expressions available for all of the above. In addition you can fetch tile type (rock, tunnel, room) at pos x/y, room top left x/y, bottom right x/y and a thin wall type between two tiles (none, wall, door).

For mazes (and other game purposes too) you can se the starting point and goal point of a maze.

Build to layout:
The dungeon is built to the layer of your choosing.

Build to layout (expanded):
To ensure all walls are at least one tile in size and to allow better door placement, the map size is epanded to x2 + 1 tiles. All corridors stay one tile wide.

Set object mapping:
Set (sprite) objects to use with the "build to layer" action. There's only rock, tunnel, room, (thin) wall and door tiles.

That should be all, see the example .cap and experiment!
